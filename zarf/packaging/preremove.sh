# Stop the service before the binary goes away — but only on actual removal.
# On upgrade dpkg passes "upgrade"/"deconfigure" and the service is deliberately
# left running: replacing the binary file is safe on Linux (the running process
# keeps its inode), and postinstall restarts it into the new version. Stopping
# here instead would make postinstall's is-active check see a stopped service
# and leave it down after every upgrade.
